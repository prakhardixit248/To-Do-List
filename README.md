# To-Do-List

1.	Create a Todo List app using HTML, JS and CSS
2.	It should have an input text box, add and clear button and a list of tasks
3.	We should be able to add todos by pressing Add button
4.	Each task can be marked completed/incomplete. Completed tasks should have gray color and strikethrough
5.	Clicking clear button should delete only the completed tasks, and the incomplete tasks should remain
